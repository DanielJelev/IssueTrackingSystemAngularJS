Issue Tracking System – AngularJS Practical Project
You are assigned to design and implement an issue tracker system. The system holds projects, which have issues. Each project has a leader (the person responsible for the project) , name, description, a project key (which should be generated by the client using the rule which is described below in the endpoints section), a set of priorities which the project’s issues can use and some labels.
Each Issue has a title, description, issue key (which is automatically generated by the system), an assignee (the person responsible to resolve the issue), a status which must follow a specific status transition (more on that below), a due date, a priority (which is some of the available priorities for the project), some labels and user-made comments.
A status transition scheme describes the workflow of an issue. See the image below for an example scheme:
 
A logged in user can view the dashboard, which depending of his role, will consist of different elements. All users can view the assigned issues to them, ordered by due date in descending order. Administrators can also create or edit issues and projects. 
The project leader can edit the project, add new issues to it and change the status of the current ones. The issue assignee has privileges to change the status of the issue.
Anonymous site visitors can only login and register. Logged in users can logout. You are given the server-side REST services to be called by your app with AJAX requests so you do not need to develop back-end.
 
Important: Commit Every Day in GitHub
Please use GitHub for your project development!
•	Commit several times a day.
o	You need to show many small commits that indicate your constant work on the project.
o	Avoid committing large blocks of code at once.
•	You should prove that you have worked at least 3-4 days over your project!
Note that Git does not require Internet connection in order to commit changes. You can commit locally and push your changes to GitHub at once. Please commit many times to show your work progress step by step.

Issue Tracker REST Services
You are given the following REST services for your Social Network SPA application.
•	Services base URL (in the Windows Azure cloud): http://softuni-issue-tracker.azurewebsites.net
•	Services help page (online documentation): http://softuni-issue-tracker.azurewebsites.net/help 
•	Services admin user (you can later make your own user admin using the “makeadmin” endpoint described below): Username: admin@softuni.bg ; Password: 123456
The documentation below provides additional details for the Social Network REST services.
Issue Tracker Web Design
You аre given the Web design and UI prototype of the Issue Tracker SPA application as a folder with screenshots. You need to convert the design to HTML + CSS. Pixel-perfect layout is not required. You do not need to match the design at all, neither the sizes, alignment, fonts nor the colors of the elements.  A responsive design is highly desirable. You can use responsive CSS frameworks like Bootstrap.

Issue Tracker SPA Application
Design and implement a client-side SPA application based on AngularJS.
AngularJS Project Structure
•	Prepare an AngularJS project structure following the industry best practices.
•	You should have separate folders for controllers, directives, filters, services, views, etc.
